/*
 IV. Which architecture would you use for the required task below? Why?
 
 The architecture that I used to build the currency converter is the MVVM with reactive approach.
 The MVVM architecture would be a great candidate here for several reasons:
 - MVVM and reactive approach works well with both real time data and high rate of data transformation.
 - High testability since each layer is decoupled from the other (model, view and the viewModel) each one can be unit tested separately.
 - High reusabilty of components.
 - Relatively easy to scale and maintain.
